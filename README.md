# Threat Hunting: Unauthorized TOR Usage
## Background and Overview
The security team was alerted by HR that some employees were considering using TOR to bypass company web filters and access restricted sites during work hours. Because corporate policy prohibits third party browsers such as TOR due to the risk of bypassing web filters, hiding user activity, and exfiltrating company data, leadership views this as a potential security and compliance issue. The security team is tasked with quietly confirming whether any employee has installed or used TOR on corporate workstations.
